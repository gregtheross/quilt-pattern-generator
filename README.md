# quilt-pattern-generator

Quick randomizer I threw together to help my wife create a triangle quilt pattern.  

Converting it to a React app for learning purposes and to extend with more features like hexagonal quilts, image backgrounds, and purchase list generator.

Original version is in the /old folder.
